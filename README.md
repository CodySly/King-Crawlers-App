<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Setting Up Xcode on an iOS Device

Before you can use or contribute to the Fruiteria iOS project, you need to have Xcode installed on your iOS device. Here are the steps to set it up:

1. **Install Xcode**:
   - Visit the App Store on your iOS device.
   - Search for "Xcode" and click on the Xcode app.
   - Tap the "Get" button to download and install Xcode.

2. **Developer Account**:
   - To access all the features and testing capabilities of Xcode, consider signing up for an [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/).

3. **Apple ID**:
   - Ensure that you're signed in with your Apple ID on your iOS device.

4. **Enable Developer Mode**:
   - Open Xcode and sign in with your Apple ID.
   - Go to Xcode Preferences > Accounts.
   - Click the "+" button and add your Apple ID.
   - Verify your account, and it should now be connected to Xcode.

## Cloning the Repository to Contribute

Now that you have Xcode set up, you can clone the Fruiteria iOS repository and start contributing. Here are the steps to clone the repository:

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Open your web browser and visit the [Fruiteria-IOS GitHub repository](https://github.com/CodySly/Fruiteria-IOS).
   - Click the "Fork" button in the upper-right corner. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**:
   - Open Xcode on your iOS device.
   - Go to Source Control > Clone.
   - In the "Clone Repository" dialog, enter the URL of your forked repository. It will be something like: `https://github.com/yourusername/Fruiteria-IOS.git`.
   - Choose the local directory where you want to save the project.
   - Click "Clone."

3. **Create a New Branch**:
   - Open the cloned project in Xcode.
   - Go to Source Control > Create Branch.
   - Name your branch and select the base branch you want to work on (usually "main" or "develop").

4. **Make Changes**:
   - Make the necessary code changes or additions in your branch.

5. **Commit Changes**:
   - Go to Source Control > Commit.
   - Enter a commit message describing your changes and commit them.

6. **Push Changes**:
   - Go to Source Control > Push to push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

7. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Visit your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "New Pull Request" button.
   - Choose the base repository (the original Fruiteria-IOS repository) and the base branch (e.g., "main" or "develop").
   - Choose your forked repository and the branch you made changes in.
   - Provide a title and description for your pull request.
   - Click "Create Pull Request."

That's it! You've successfully cloned the repository, made changes, and created a pull request to contribute to the Fruiteria iOS project.

## Installing a Test Version of the App on Your iPhone

If you want to run the app on your own iPhone for testing or development purposes, follow these steps. This process is often referred to as "sideloading" the app onto your device.

### Prerequisites

- **Apple Developer Account**: To install an app on your iPhone, you need to have a free or paid Apple Developer Account. If you don't have one, you can sign up on the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/account/).

### Step 1: Set Up Xcode

1. Open Xcode on your Mac.

2. Ensure that your Xcode is configured with your Apple Developer account. To do this:

   - Go to Xcode Preferences.
   - Under the "Accounts" tab, click the "+" button and sign in with your Apple Developer account.

### Step 2: Configure Your iPhone

1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac using a USB cable.

2. In Xcode, open your project by selecting the appropriate workspace or project file.

3. Select your iPhone as the deployment target. To do this:

   - Click on the device name in the top toolbar (e.g., "Generic iOS Device").
   - Choose your iPhone from the list.

### Step 3: Build and Install

1. In Xcode, press the "Play" button (or use `Cmd+R`) to build and run the app on your iPhone. Xcode will compile the app and install it on your device.

2. The app will appear on your iPhone's home screen, and you can launch it like any other app.

### Step 4: Trust the Developer Certificate

The first time you run the app on your device, you may encounter an "Untrusted Developer" error. To resolve this:

1. On your iPhone, go to **Settings** > **General** > **Device Management** (or "Profiles & Device Management").

2. Under the "Developer App" section, tap your Apple ID and trust the developer certificate associated with your account.

### Step 5: Run the App

You should now be able to run and test the app on your iPhone. Any changes you make in Xcode and re-run the app will be reflected on your device.

Remember that you'll need to repeat these steps each time you update the app in Xcode or if you reinstall it after a certain period, as the developer certificate may expire.

**Note**: This guide covers the basic steps for sideloading an app during development. To distribute the app to a wider audience, you would need to follow Apple's guidelines for App Store distribution or use TestFlight for beta testing.
